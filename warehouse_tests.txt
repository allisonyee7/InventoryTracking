main.py
=======

We will need to be able to generate a catalog of footwear for testing purposes,
and to read and write the catalog to a file so that the same catalog can be
used repeatedly. Let's choose some names for the functions that will do this.

  >>> from main import make_catalog, get_catalog, save_catalog

Now we need to be able to make a catalog, save it, and read it back in.

  >>> cat1 = make_catalog(5)
  >>> save_catalog(cat1, 'cat.dat')
  >>> cat2 = get_catalog('cat.dat')
  >>> cat1 == cat2
  True

In between, we need to know that the catalog contains footwear type objects.

   >>> 'size' in cat1[2].__dict__.keys()
   True
   >>> 'type' in cat1[0].__dict__.keys()
   True
   >>> 'sku' in cat1[4].__dict__.keys()
   True
